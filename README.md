# Sword Damage Calculator WPF
To find the number of hit
points (HP) of damage for
a sword attack, roll 3d6 
(three 6-sided dice) and
add “base damage” of 3HP.
∫ Some swords are flaming, which causes an extra 2HP
of damage. 
∫ Some swords are magic. For
magic swords, the 3d6 roll
is multiplied by 1.75 and
rounded down, and the base
damage and flaming damage
are added to the result.

The project is a simple Windows Presentation Foundation.
The main focus for this project is working with encapsulation which inherited the SwordDamage class from the SwordDamageCalculator console applications
,an important pillar of object-oriented programming. 
The simple Windows Presentation Foundation include and works with Fields, Constants, Properties, Methods, Constructors & access modifiers
and creating a simple UI.
